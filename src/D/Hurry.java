 * Hurry must:
 * - Be the main thread
 * - Create the Lazy thread.
 * - Wait for Lazy to finish. Each second it must print the message: “Aren’t you ready yet?” and checks if Lazy is finished.
 * - If Lazy isn’t finished after 5 seconds, Hurry will claim “You are resting in your laurels… and I am leaving!” and interrupts Lazy. Then it waits for Lazy to finish.
 * - However, if Lazy finishes before the 5 seconds deadline, Hurry says “At last, a turtle runs rings round you!”.
